# Tkinter CLI
A CLI designed as a shell to run tkinter commands and see the tkinter window update. More or less like a GUI building tool. It helps you understand how to structure your tkinter application and which commands to do so. Just download Tkinter CLI.py, and run it. You will see the shell after that.
